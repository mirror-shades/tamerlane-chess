# Tamerlane Chess C++

I am building a Tamerlane chess engine in C++. This engine was previously built in Pygame but the performance made building a proper AI messy. This engine will let us better explore the strategies of this ancient chess varient.

## Compiling

using minGW 6.1.0 > 6.3.0, run in powershell:
`mingw32-make -f Makefile; if ($?) { ./build/main.exe }`
