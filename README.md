# Tamerlane Chess C++

I am building a Tamerlane chess engine in C++. This engine was previously built in Pygame but the performance made building a proper AI messy. This engine will let us better explore the strategies of this ancient chess varient.

## Compiling

using minGW 6.1.0 > 6.3.0, run in powershell:
`mingw32-make -f Makefile; if ($?) { ./main.exe }`

## todo

[x] init SFML  
[x] draw board  
[x] implement clicking  
[x] draw pieces  
[ ] implement moves  
[ ] implement piece rules  
[ ] implement game rules  
[ ] implement menus  
[ ] implement AI
